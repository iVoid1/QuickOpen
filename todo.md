# TODO List - Quick Open Project

## 1. Frontend - UI Improvement

- [ ]  Design a clean, simple, and responsive user interface.
- [ ]  Add useful buttons (Search, Refresh, Execute, Cancel).
- [ ]  Display shortcuts data in an organized way (table or list).
- [ ]  Update data dynamically without full page reload.
- [ ]  **Use React.js** for building the UI to leverage components, state management, and instant updates.

## 2. API Handling - Maximize Usage

- [ ]  Understand and implement HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- [ ]  Organize API into clear, well-defined endpoints.
- [ ]  Validate incoming/outgoing data.
- [ ]  Add multiple API endpoints/pages to receive different data types.
- [ ]  Document the API simply (README or Swagger).

## 3. Language and Scan Codes Handling

- [ ]  Create a dictionary/JSON mapping scan codes to button names.
- [ ]  Support multi-language (Arabic/English) with dynamic conversion based on keyboard layout.
- [ ]  Ensure translation is dynamic and easy to update.

## 4. Tray Shortcuts (System Tray)

- [ ]  Add useful shortcuts in tray menu (Open UI, Reload, Toggle Listening, Quit).
- [ ]  Handle tray menu events properly in Electron.
- [ ]  **Add feature to pause listening if no keypress detected for a set time** to prevent multiple program instances opening.

## 5. Code Cleanup - Quality & Maintainability

- [ ]  Use clear and consistent variable naming.
- [ ]  Split code into modules/files by functionality.
- [ ]  Remove unused/dead code.
- [ ]  Add meaningful comments and documentation for key functions.

## 6. Performance Optimization & Speed

- [ ]  Use efficient data structures (e.g., dicts instead of loops for lookup).
- [ ]  Lazy load data only when needed.
- [ ]  Reduce calls between frontend and API.
- [ ]  Use async/await effectively, avoid unnecessary sleep/waits.
- [ ]  **Review all async/await usage for real benefit**, track code flow to understand execution paths.

## 7. Additional Recommendations from Me

- [ ]  Build a centralized logging system capturing output/logs from both Python and Electron.
- [ ]  Improve UX with tooltips, confirmation dialogs, and visual feedback.
- [ ]  Setup a complete dev environment with easy scripts to run/manage the project.
- [ ]  Design the API for scalability and easy feature addition.
- [ ]  Prevent multiple instances of Electron/Python processes running simultaneously.
- [ ]  Monitor keyboard listening status and pause it automatically when user is inactive.

---

# General Notes

- [ ]  Ensure deep understanding of async/await and concurrency in Python and JavaScript.
- [ ]  Review overall app design for smooth flow between UI, API, and keyboard handling.
